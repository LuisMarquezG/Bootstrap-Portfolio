# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## Description
This is the challenge for week three which consists of creating a portfolio using Bootstrap.
- I did this project because I had to improve the portfolio that I made last week.
- I have learned:
   - How to work with Bootstrap and the basic philosophy of the framework.
   - Some classes of Bootstrap and how to use them.
   - How to path images properly to show them correctly when the app is deployed.
   - How to make an avatar,
   - How to work with variables for colours.
   - How to use placeholders.
   - I have tried to apply media queries unsuccessfully but I have learned there are no tools online for writing them.
